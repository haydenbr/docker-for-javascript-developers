# Docker for JavaScript Developers

You can either run the slides directly on your machine or inside a container.

To run the slides directly on your machine, `yarn install` and then `yarn serve`.

To run the slides from a docker container, you can either `yarn start` or `docker-compose up`.

You can check out the demo-notes.md to see the hands on examples.

The slides use [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/).
